cpr - change palette randomly
-----------------------------

About
-----

Swap instantly between existing palettes, changing your terminal colors from a matching selection of dark and light themes.

cpr is very much inspired by:

paleta
https://github.com/dylanaraps/paleta

okpal
https://github.com/dylanaraps/okpal


Install
-------

Clone the repo.

    $ cd && git clone https://github.com/fehawen/cpr.git

Run make install. This will install cpr to ~/bin by default, because that's the
way I like it.

Add ~/.bin to your PATH if not already present.

Set the environment variable CPR_LIB to point to this directory, and persist
colors, by adding the following to whichever shellrc you're using.

    export CPR_LIB=~/cpr
    cpr revive
